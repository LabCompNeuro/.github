# Computational neuroscience and machine learning

Our lab develops and applies machine learning methods to derive mechanistic insight in neuroscience.

Advances in experimental methods are generating data at an unprecedented scale and resolution, at the single neuron, neural network, and behaviour levels. Extracting knowledge from this wealth of data increasingly depends on accurate, scalable and interpretable theoretical models of neural activity and behaviour. In our lab, we believe that such effort can be potentiated with modern machine learning methods.

Despite the tremendous advances in machine learning, most machine learning methods are not geared at generating interpretable insights. Our lab answers these needs by developing and applying machine learning methods for mechanistic insight in neuroscience. In close collaboration with experimental partners, we aim to design more accurate models, quantitatively test mechanistic hypotheses and derive experimentally-testable predictions, with the ultimate goal of refining our understanding of neural systems in health and disease.

We are based at [NERF](https://nerf.be/en#/) in Leuven, Belgium. You can find out more about us on our [lab website](https://goncalveslab.sites.vib.be/en).
