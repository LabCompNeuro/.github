Our lab develops and applies machine learning methods to derive mechanistic insight in neuroscience

In close collaboration with experimental partners, we aim to design more accurate theoretical models, quantitatively test mechanistic hypotheses and derive experimentally-testable predictions, with the ultimate goal of refining our understanding of neural systems in health and disease.
